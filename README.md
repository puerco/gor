# gor: The ultimate time saver for go programmers

According to studies[^1], hundreds of thousands of human hours and CPU cycles are
lost every day because golang hax0rs simply type too fast and insted of typing:

```
go run .
```

The rush leads them to fatfingering:

```
gor un .
```

## Enter `gor`

`gor` is a revolutionary tool with the potential to save the planet. According
to research[^2] millions of tons of CO2 are released to the atmosphere daily
caused by computers spinning up disks to search their filesystems for a `gor`
command. Well, search no more magnetic friends!

With `gor` even the more 3lit3 h4x0r can f-up their `go run` invocations and have
them still work. Best of all? Its pretty easy! And free[^3]!

### Installation

To install gor simply download it from the release page, chmod it 0755 and 
you. are. done. 

```bash
https://github.com/puerco/gor/releases/download/v1.0.0/gor
chmod 0755 gor
sudo mv gor /usr/local/bin
```

### Usage

`gor` is super easy to run. It supports a single subcommand: `un`.

The `un` subcommand supports the same arguments as `go run`, this is because
it is really invoking `go run` under the hood. IS THAT SMART OR WHAT!?!?!

Anyway, I digress, here is an example:

```
gor un cmd/hello/ 
HELLO WORLD!
```

__AMAZING, I KNOW.__

I don't have a soundcloud or onlyfans but I am grateful for those good vibes I
am already feeling from you. You are the best.

[^1]: I haven't found the studies but I'm pretty sure they're out there somewhere.
[^2]: Again, it must be there but I don't have access to JSTOR since I am not a
student anymore so I can't properly quote. Just believe me, I'm sure the claims
are solid.
[^3]: Both as in beer and freedom, neat huh?
